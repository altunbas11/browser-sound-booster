# Permission Justifications for Browser Sound Booster

## Chrome Web Store Submission Requirements

This document provides detailed justifications for all permissions requested by the Browser Sound Booster extension.

## Permissions & Justifications

### 1. activeTab
**Permission Type:** API Permission
**Justification:**
- **Purpose**: Grants temporary access to the currently active browser tab
- **Necessity**: Essential for the core functionality of audio boosting. The extension needs to access the active tab's audio context to apply volume amplification using the Web Audio API
- **Scope Limitation**: Only provides access to the currently active tab, not all tabs or background access
- **User Control**: Users must click the extension icon to activate it on each tab
- **Security**: Follows principle of least privilege - access is temporary and user-initiated

### 2. tabs
**Permission Type:** API Permission
**Justification:**
- **Purpose**: Allows reading of tab information and communication with content scripts
- **Necessity**: Required for the popup interface to identify the active tab and send volume control messages to the content script running on that tab
- **Scope Limitation**: Read-only access to basic tab properties (ID, URL, title), no modification capabilities
- **Usage**: Used solely for extension-to-content-script communication, not for tracking user browsing

### 3. storage
**Permission Type:** API Permission
**Justification:**
- **Purpose**: Enables local storage of user preferences and volume settings
- **Necessity**: Allows the extension to remember volume levels per website/domain, providing a better user experience
- **Scope Limitation**: Local browser storage only (chrome.storage.local), no access to cookies or other storage
- **Privacy**: All data stays on the user's device, nothing is transmitted to external servers
- **Data Stored**: Only volume percentages and mute states, no personal information

### 4. Host Permissions: <all_urls>
**Permission Type:** Host Permission
**Justification:**
- **Purpose**: Allows the content script to run on any website the user visits
- **Necessity**: Audio boosting functionality should work on all websites where users consume media (YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, podcasts, games, etc.)
- **Scope Limitation**: Content script only activates when the user clicks the extension icon - no automatic injection on all sites
- **User Control**: Users have full control over when and where the extension runs
- **Transparency**: Extension clearly indicates when it's active on a tab

### Removed Permission: scripting
**Status:** Removed from manifest.json
**Reason:** Not needed since content script is declared in manifest.json rather than injected programmatically
**Alternative:** Manifest-declared content scripts provide the same functionality without requiring additional permissions
**Permission Type:** Host Permission
**Justification:**
- **Purpose**: Allows the content script to run on any website the user visits
- **Necessity**: Audio boosting functionality should work on all websites where users consume media (YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, podcasts, games, etc.)
- **Scope Limitation**: Content script only activates when the user clicks the extension icon - no automatic injection on all sites
- **User Control**: Users have full control over when and where the extension runs
- **Transparency**: Extension clearly indicates when it's active on a tab

## Single Purpose Compliance

All permissions directly support the extension's **single, well-defined purpose**: boosting browser tab audio levels up to 300%.

### Permission Mapping to Functionality:
- **activeTab**: Access current tab to communicate with content script
- **tabs**: Communicate between popup UI and content script
- **storage**: Remember user volume preferences
- **<all_urls>**: Allow content script to run on any website with media

### Permissions NOT Requested (and why):
- **cookies**: Not needed for audio processing
- **history**: No browsing history access required
- **bookmarks**: No bookmark manipulation needed
- **downloads**: No file download functionality
- **notifications**: No system notifications used
- **scripting**: Removed - content script declared in manifest instead
- **webRequest**: No network request interception needed

## Privacy & Security Commitment

- **No data collection**: Extension does not send any data to external servers
- **Local storage only**: All settings remain on the user's device
- **User-initiated only**: Extension only runs when explicitly activated by the user
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests permissions essential for audio boosting
- **Transparent operation**: Users can see when the extension is active

## Testing & Validation

The extension has been tested to ensure:
- All permissions are used only for their stated purposes
- No unnecessary data access or storage occurs
- Extension functions correctly with granted permissions
- Removal of any permission breaks core functionality
